# Sorted CSS Colors

I wanted to create a tool to sort the named CSS colors in a way that it shows related colors together. So, next time I can't decide between a few CSS colors, I can just check them here side by side.

Here's how it looks:

It's a Progressive Web App! It works both in mobile and desktop, even offline. If you liked the tool I suggest adding it to your home screen / downloading it as desktop app, so you can easily access it whenever you need. Also, please feel free to report any bugs or provide feedbacks by [creating issues](https://github.com/scriptype/sorted-colors/issues).
